Size Occupied by Ships:
	Formula:    ((Length * 3) + 2) * Number of this type
	Battleship: ((5 * 3) + 2) * 1 = (15 + 2) * 1 = 17 * 1 = 17
	Cruiser:    ((4 * 3) + 2) * 2 = (12 + 2) * 2 = 14 * 2 = 28
	Destroyer:  ((3 * 3) + 2) * 3 = (09 + 2) * 3 = 11 * 2 = 22
	Corvette:   ((2 * 3) + 2) * 4 = (06 + 2) * 4 = 08 * 4 = 32
	Total Space occupied = 91
